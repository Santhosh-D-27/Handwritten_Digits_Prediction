This code snippet loads the digits dataset, preprocesses the image data, trains a random forest model, and evaluates its performance. The images are 8x8 pixel arrays representing handwritten digits (0-9). After scaling the pixel values, the model predicts the digit labels for the test data. The classification report provides details on accuracy and other metrics
